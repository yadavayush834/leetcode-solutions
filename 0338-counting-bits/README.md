# 338. Counting Bits

`Easy` · [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/) · Topics: `Dynamic Programming`, `Bit Manipulation`

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return *an array* `ans` *of length* `n + 1` *such that for each* `i`(`0 <= i <= n`)*,* `ans[i]` *is the **number of*** `1`***'s** in the binary representation of* `i`.

Do not solve it with built-in functions (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= n <= 105`

**Follow up:**

* It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
